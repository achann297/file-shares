Instead of browsing or sending data through a server through your personal IP, you would instead activate a VPN and run through the VPN server, and access the internet that way without having the risk of losing critical information. VPNs create an IP address to mask your current IP.

VPNs are an important part in everyday work in companies, due to the fact no company wants their important information easy to access, or stolen.
- Remote workers, workers who operate from their household, would use VPNs to work off-site to access company information and resources over a private internet, rather than their own.
- Large companies would use VPNs for Site-to-Site access to keep their internal connection secure across multiple site locations.


<h2>Why use a VPN?</h2>

<p>
It is important for anyone to keep company or personal information secure, and it is important to establish a direct and secure connection to ensure data traffic is under safe measures. Not only that, but it protects the main IP address, thus protecting identity. Allowing externals to have access to that information would lead to corruption. VPNs also allow you to access many servers around the world, such examples are that there are VPN server connections in Japan, Europe, Canada, and anyone could establish a VPN connection to a server there.
