<h1>File Sharing</h1>
File sharing in a computer is essentially a process to send something out from your computer to another in joint access. Such example is that a folder that not only you access, but the overall network or directory can access based on permissions and groups. Using file shares are more efficient than sending constant emails back and forth of new file updates, or having access to certain files. File shares from Google Drive, Google Docs, Microsoft Excel are other programs other than just Windows.

<h2>Purpose of File Sharing </h2>

Rather than sending out new programs or file updates or new documents constantly through email, file sharing can be used by an Admin to grant permissions to a wide range of users to limit the time used by the admin and it is also an easier way to keep everything organized and up to date. This is a big advantage for workers that are Remote, as it is more simplified for them to click on a shared folder where they have "Read permissions" for files. I.T teams can benefit from file sharing to limit the amount of storage used for certain files and programs, and to collectively access up to date programs. Companies can increase productivity and workflow without having to worry if each worker are having access to certain files and having to worry about running out of storage, or constantly looking for cluttered information. 


<h2>VPN Usage</h2>

VPNs are an important part in everyday work in companies, due to the fact no company wants their important information easy to access, or stolen.
- Remote workers, workers who operate from their household, would use VPNs to work off-site to access company information and resources over a private internet, rather than their own.
- Large companies would use VPNs for Site-to-Site access to keep their internal connection secure across multiple site locations.


<h2>Why use a VPN?</h2>

<p>
It is important for anyone to keep company or personal information secure, and it is important to establish a direct and secure connection to ensure data traffic is under safe measures. Not only that, but it protects the main IP address, thus protecting identity. Allowing externals to have access to that information would lead to corruption. VPNs also allow you to access many servers around the world, such examples are that there are VPN server connections in Japan, Europe, Canada, and anyone could establish a VPN connection to a server there.
